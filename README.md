# IEEE Computer Society - Machine Learning Workshop

This workshop is created to introduce Students to the concept of Deep Learning.
As part of this workshop, we will show students how to create, train, and export
Nueral Networks. As part of this, students will also be introduced to quantization
and compilation techniques to reduce the size of models to run on weaker hardware.

## Getting Started Programming

### Requirements

This workshop is going to require that you have uv installed. uv is a single
command line interface Python development tool. It is excellent for quickly
building and testing python applications and libraries. I highly suggest
you try to use it in your Python projects.

#### Install UV

Use the following link to install uv on your computer
<https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>

### Running Jupyter Notebook

UV provides a really nice interface to start a Jupyter Notebook server
to run your code on and train your models all on your own computer.

In order to run jupyter notebook, you will need to run the following
code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash


```
